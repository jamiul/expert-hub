                        <p>
                            ExpertGate was founded by Dr. Mohammad Riyadh and Mrs. Jannat Bahar CA. Their collective
                            experience of over two decades in academia, industry, and the Australian government and
                            their struggle to find academic experts for a university accreditation process sparked the
                            idea for ExpertGate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mohammad and Jannat engaged with numerous academic and industry experts, revealing a
                            significant gap in the market for a platform that promotes academic and industry expertise
                            in one accessible place. ExpertGate is the solution they envisioned, benefiting universities
                            in curriculum development or course design, industries advancing their LMS or improving
                            staff soft skills, or a higher degree student refining their research skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recognising the limitations of existing professional networking platforms, Mohammad and
                            Jannat dreamt of a dedicated space where academics and industry experts could easily
                            showcase their expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ExpertGate goes beyond the conventional marketplace model, offering a holistic solution to
                            diverse academic needs. It simplifies the process of posting academic projects and enables
                            informed decision-making by reviewing expressions of interest from top experts. Security is
