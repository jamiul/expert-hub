                            ExpertGate was founded by Dr. Mohammad Riyadh and Mrs. Jannat Bahar CA. Their collective experience of over two decades in academia, industry, and the Australian government and their struggle to find academic experts for a university accreditation process sparked the idea for ExpertGate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mohammad and Jannat engaged with numerous academic and industry experts, revealing a significant gap in the market for a platform that promotes academic and industry expertise in one accessible place. ExpertGate is the solution they envisioned, benefiting universities in curriculum development or course design, industries advancing their LMS or improving staff soft skills, or a higher degree student refining their research skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recognising the limitations of existing professional networking platforms, Mohammad and Jannat dreamt of a dedicated space where academics and industry experts could easily showcase their expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ExpertGate goes beyond the conventional marketplace model, offering a holistic solution to diverse academic needs. It simplifies the process of posting academic projects and enables informed decision-making by reviewing expressions of interest from top experts. Security is a priority, with a system that holds payments in escrow until project completion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
