                                        <p>This two-day online course introduces participants to the state-of-the-art of
                                            partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using the
                                            SmartPLS 4 software. PLS is a composite-based approach to SEM. Compared to
                                            other SEM techniques, PLS-SEM allows researchers to estimate very complex
                                            models with many constructs and indicators. Furthermore, the method allows
                                            estimating reflectively and formatively specified constructs and generally
                                            offers much flexibility in terms of data requirements.</p>
                                        <p>Several review studies substantiate that PLS-SEM has become a standard method

                                        <p>The first day of the course provides a profound introduction to latent

                                            PLS-SEM and how to apply it by means of the SmartPLS 4 software. The second
                                            day will cover the evaluation of the measurement and structural models,
                                            including recent developments in model evaluation. The instructors will make

                                        <p>As an AI assistant, I cannot definitively prescribe specific textbooks or
                                            software for this course without more information about the instructor's
                                            preferences, the university's policies, and the specific focus of the

                                            make informed choices:</p>
                                        <p class="mb-0"> Prescribed Textbook:</p>
                                        <ul>

                                            <li> It's uncommon for online courses to have a single prescribed
                                                textbook, especially in a dynamic field like curriculum
                                                design. Instructors often prefer to curate a selection of readings and
                                                resources based on current trends and their own expertise.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> Instead of a textbook, the course might utilize open educational
                                                resources (OERs) or articles from academic journals and
                                                publications. This helps keep costs down and ensures participants have
                                                access to the latest research and best practices.
                                            </li>
                                            <li> If there is a recommended textbook, you can usually find it listed on
                                                the course syllabus or learning management system.
